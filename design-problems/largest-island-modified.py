ðŸ”„ Follow-Up Problem: Flip One Water Cell to Land
Scenario Extension:
Given the same m x n grid of 0s and 1s (water and land), you are now allowed to flip at most one 0 to 1.

Question:
What is the maximum possible island size you can obtain after flipping exactly one water cell to land?

ðŸ§¾ Example:
Input:

python
Copy
Edit
grid = [
  [0, 0, 1, 0],
  [1, 1, 1, 0],
  [0, 1, 0, 0],
  [1, 0, 1, 1]
]
Output:

python
Copy
Edit
3
Explanation:
Flipping the 0 at (0,1) connects two separate 1s diagonally adjacent. The resulting island size is 3.
