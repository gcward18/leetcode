ðŸ§  Problem 4: Task Scheduler with Cooldown (Greedy + Heap)
Scenario:
You're given a list of CPU tasks, each represented by a capital letter A to Z.
Each task takes exactly 1 unit of time, but identical tasks must be separated by at least n units of cooldown time.

âœ… Your Goal:
Return the minimum total time the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks, including idle time.

ðŸ§¾ Example:
python
Copy
Edit
tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"]
n = 2
Output:

Copy
Edit
8
Explanation:
One possible schedule: A â†’ B â†’ idle â†’ A â†’ B â†’ idle â†’ A â†’ B
Total time: 8 units
