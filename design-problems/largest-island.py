üîç Problem: Largest Island in a Grid (Graph / DFS / Union-Find)
Scenario:
You are given an m x n binary grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water. An island is a group of 1s connected horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).

Question:
Return the size (number of cells) of the largest island in the grid.

üßæ Example:
Input:

python
Copy
Edit
grid = [
  [0, 0, 1, 0],
  [1, 1, 1, 0],
  [0, 1, 0, 0],
  [1, 0, 0, 1]
]
Output:

python
Copy
Edit
5
Explanation:
The central island (connected 1s) has a size of 5, which is the largest.

‚úÖ Constraints:
1 <= m, n <= 1000

You can mutate the input grid or use a visited set

Expected time complexity: O(m * n)
